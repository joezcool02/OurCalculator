### Before you contribute-

Make sure your commits are in accordance to the rules mentioned below, and also make sure to configure the CRLF and LF settings on your machine to avoid line ending character issues which makes it difficult to see diffs.

A `.gitattributes` file has been added to take care of this but just to be completely foolproof. Ensure that you follow the steps below:

### Additional steps, everyone on a windows system, please do the following-

+ Open up cmd and type, `git config --global core.autocrlf`, if nothing shows up then do 
`git config --global core.autocrlf true`
+ Now, make sure it worked by typing `git config --global core.autocrlf` again and you should see `true` being written out.

If you'd like to contribute a change:
 - Check out the Issues page to see if your edit resolves any open issues.
 - If it does, *leave a comment* on the issue saying that you are working on the issue. This helps prevent multiple people from writing the same code.
 - File a pull request with `OC-#` at the beginning of the title. (Where # is the Issue number your pull request works to solve)

## Style guide
+ Indent style: ["K&R"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#K.26R)  
+ Use 2 spaces to indent your code, pressing `Ctrl+T` in the Processing editor should automatically format your code according to these rules.
